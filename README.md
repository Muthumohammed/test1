Flower Species Prediction using Flask
This repository contains a web application built with Flask that predicts the species of a flower based on user input. The application uses a pre-trained machine learning model to classify flowers into different species (e.g., Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, Iris Virginica) based on features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Features:
Flask Web Framework: A lightweight and easy-to-use web framework for Python.

Machine Learning Model: A pre-trained model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Network) for flower species prediction.

Interactive Web Interface: A simple and user-friendly interface to input flower features and get predictions.

REST API: Exposes an API endpoint for programmatic access to the prediction model.

How to Use:
Clone the repository.

Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Run the Flask application using python app.py.

Access the web interface at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and input flower features to get predictions.

Technologies Used:
Python

Flask

Scikit-learn (for the machine learning model)

HTML/CSS (for the frontend)

Bootstrap (optional, for styling)

Dataset:
The model is trained on the popular Iris dataset, which includes 150 samples of iris flowers with four features each.
